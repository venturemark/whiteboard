# What To Do First

Venturemark wants to turn a professional network into a problem solving machine.
Venturemark needs to start somewhere. Venturemark needs to start with something.

### Context

There are a lot of very good ideas. We just cannot pursue all of them
simultaneously, especially not when we just start out. This is why it is
important to define a focus so that we can do one thing very well. We need to be
the best in one thing so that we can show we solve a real problem. This is why
we need a certain more narrow scope for which we then can generate the best
ideas for.

### Alternatives

- We focus on Founders.
- We focus on Investors.
- We focus on Stakeholders.

### Decisions

We focus on single-player mode for Founders to create updates.

### Consequences

- We largely ignore the investor/stakeholder experience for now
- We assume that we can 'jump-start' the Venturemark network by having founders create the content that attracts investors and other stakeholders.
- We assume that founders will be motivated to create updates without direct investor or other stakeholder engagement.
