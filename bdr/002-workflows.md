# Workflows

### Context

When a user publishes an update, Venturemark enacts a sequence of actions that we call a workflow.

We intend for user actions to increase future value for the creator of the update and future recipients by anticipating and automating future, relevant actions.

This is a new idea. We need to clarify it.

We can do this by:

1. defining the design problem a workflow solves (what it is and is not)
2. creating a list of workflows for founders
3. prioritizing the first workflow we intend to make available to this user
