# Templates Design

Venturemark wants to lower the work required to create an update.

### Context

Aside from the physical mouse clicks, creating an update requires mental effort in:

- Deciding intent
- Choosing audience
- Choose structure to fulfill intent to audience
- Select value (if metric) or context outline that will provide the most future value
- filling in the structure

We believe we can reduce this effort by providing pre-formatted update templates that prompt the user how to answer and which types of information to include.

This may take the form of suggested metrics for a certain stage startup or providing a default template for a introduction ask or a brainstorm session.

This is a new idea. We need to clarify it. **What template design should we start with?**

We can do this by:

1. defining the design problem a template solves (what it is and is not)
2. creating a list of templates for common founder use cases
3. prioritizing the first template we intend to make available to this user

### Alternatives

- suggested metrics
- suggested update types

### Decisions

TBD

### Consequences
