# Fingerprint Design

Venturemark wants to define a method to compare updates.

### Context

An important component of Venturemark's system is to increase the expected value of an update.

One way we can do this is by surfacing a user's updates to that same user in the future or to other users when relevant.

The job of the 'fingerprint' is to score how relevant an update is to other updates.

We want to determine:

- what information we want to capture
- i.e. context, scale, audience, other relations
- how to weight this information
- how the weighting of this information can evolve over time
- how we can compare the fingerprint of one update to anothe
