# Feature: Card Flip

Venturemark wants to simplify the experience browsing updates

### Context

It's hard for users to see graphs and updates together.

The design problem is that we want the user to view the update from different perspectives without losing track of where they are.

We believe a more efficient design treats the update like a card that flips to reveal a different perspective or context.

The scope incorporates:

- dots on the side of the card that imply positions along x and y axis.
- update 'flips' and graph becomes visible where the dots are clicked

### Alternatives

TBD

### Decisions

TBD

### Consequences

We believe that we will simplify the experience while enabling additional context to be accessed.
