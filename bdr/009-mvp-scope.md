# MVP SCOPE

We wanted to narrowly define our intended experience for our MVP.


### Context

We have an ideal experience we intend to build but need to first build a product quickly that we can get feedback on and iterate.

We need to choose which features to build first.

(brainstorm link)[https://github.com/venturemark/whiteboard/tree/master/utb]


### Decisions

- The core user experience is a single timeline of metric updates.
- The user simply writes in the action bar. And can create an update with just 1-click
- We will focus on six features we think are cool:
  - flip update to reveal graph
  - discover where update is in timeline
  - placeholder design for hashtags and mentions
  - publicly shareable url
  - editor
  - data point links


### Alternatives

* Focus only on metric updates
* Allow for multiple update types
* Build in privacy considerations
* Build in a dispatch system



### Consequences

We believe this decision shortens build time while offering the minimum viable experience to get to our vision.
