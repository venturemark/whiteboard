# Target User

We aim to define our target user segment in order to constrain product scope.


### Context

It is important for us to limit who we target in order to categorize user insights and decrease the number of possible good solutions. Even by narrowing down to __Founders__, there are many types. Which segment we target influences our possible product and growth strategies.


### Decisions


We're focusing on early stage Venture-backed founders.

**For them Venturemark will be a tool of:**
- reflection
- accountability
- comparison

**Criteria for users in order of importance:**
  - Are founders that value understanding and benchmarking progress
  - Have rapidly growing revenue or engagement
  - Have received investment from a top-tier investor
  - Part of a large, engaged venture network
  - Based near a top tier tech hub
    - San Francisco, then
    - Singapore
    - London
    - Tel Aviv
    - Tokyo
    - New York



### Alternatives

* Venture backed founders
* Small, medium business founders
* Bootstrapped founders
* Social impact founders
* Hobbyists



### Consequences

We believe limiting our user segment increases potential for product adoption, satisfaction, and growth.

Advantages of targeting venture-backed founders:
- They have money allocated towards accelerating progress (they have greater purchasing power)
- As young ventures they are willing to adopt new technology (potentially less effort spent on customer acquisition)
- Through their investors, they have access to deep entrepreneurial networks (more network collisions increase word-of-mouth potential)
- Marketing messages can directly address shared niche pain points
- Their investors provide increased pressure to win, fast.
- Early customers we engage can serve as social proof for later customers
