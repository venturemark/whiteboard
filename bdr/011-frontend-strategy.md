# Frontend Development Strategy

Frontend development is slow. Should we change our strategy?



### Context

We suspect the current rate of frontend development is not fast enough to build a product that engages users within Q1 of 2021.

This is contrary to our value to aggressively make progress.

In order to align our values, we must consider our alternatives to ensure our planning is aggressive and realistic.



### Decisions

Marcus will put full effort into making progress. We will evaluate our progress on December 23rd.

**What information would helps us make this decision?**
  - What is our current build rate?
  - What is our desired build rate?
  - For each alternative,
    - How long will onboarding take?
    - At what predicted rate can we move at our budget?
    - How long will it take to reach sustainability?




### Alternatives

1. Continue as we have
2. We bring onboard a founder-level frontend developer
3. Pay someone to help



### Consequences

TBD on decision
