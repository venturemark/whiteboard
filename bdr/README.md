# BDR - Business Decision Record

A BDR helps to frigure out in which direction we want to go together. We need to
be able to articulate problems and solutions well. If we cannot explain a
problem or its solution, we do not understand neither of it. BDRs aim to help us
structuring our thoughts and guiding our conversations. Any input is welcome.
Below is explained how a BDR is structured and how it can be used.



### Structure

The structure below shows how a BDR is outlined. It starts with the **topic**
that describes the scope of the necessary decisions we have to make. The topic
must be on point and should not have more than 5 words. The BDR continues with
the **context** that describes the boundaries of the topic itself. The context
explains why the BDR is necessary. The context describes why certain decisions
must be made. Following comes the **alternatives** section that provides a list
of options we have at our disposal. A decision must be derived from a listed
alternative. Next come the **decisions** we make. This section explains what
kind of decision we made and why we make it. Last but not least we conclude the
BDR with **consequences** which describe the implications of the decisions we
make. This section must make very clear what we expect to happen next.
