# Shadow Networks



### Context

- Based on feedback of potential customers we gained more insights into customer
  needs and painpoints. Based on our feedback sessions we draw conclusions for
  the next iteration of our product evolution.
- Our new target destination is codename shadow networks, aka private twitter,
  aka milestone tracker. The gist of functionality we want to enable is to give
  a specific audience a specific place to engage about progress.
- Our goal right now is not to build a functioning product. Our goal is to
  provide a web-app that makes founders feel how it would be to use the product
  we would build for them in case they like the dummy prototype.



### Alternatives

- Due to the nature of refining our product stragey there is currently no
  alternative defined.



### Decisions

- We want to build fast. This means we do not want to get blocked by the
  backend. All we need is a frontend that let's people experience how it would
  be like to use the product if we would build it for real. In 7 days we would
  like to have the next feedback sessions with our potential customers.
- We want to build a frontend prototype without backend during this iteration.
  The backend is mocked using local storage.
- It does not have to be perfect right now. It does not have to be pretty.
- Generic backend functionality can be implemented already so that we can
  already prepare for an eventual beta launch.
- Conceptually, our first class citizen is an organization. An organization has
  timelines. A timeline is accessible for an audience. An audience is a group of
  users. A timeline is the place to write updates. As a bonus, an update has
  comments and replies.



### Consequences

- [Marcus] continues strategic business development and assists with directional
  guidance.
- [Thiago] gets synchronized and builds the frontend. This is the only focus we
  need right now.
- [Tim] prepares a technical spec and pairs with Thiago. Further Tim tries to
  continue building generic backend technology that can prove to be useful in
  any case of strategy deviation.
