#### 1. What does the user see first?

The user sees a single timeline of metric updates.



#### 2. How does the user create an update?

For the MVP the user simply writes in the action bar. With more text the action
bar extends vertically. When providing text for the update a send button appears
to the right, moving any other icons down. Upon clicking the send button the
update gets created and the action bar resets. Bonus points for submitting at
"cmd+enter".



#### 3. How does the user define what kind of update she writes?

The MVP only offers one update type.


#### 4. How does the user provide the metric?

We choose the first number of number-word, so this resembles 'smart-detection' without actually being smart.


#### 5. Do we have to provide an input field?

No.


#### 6. What happens when the user creates the update?

The user stays where they are. The update card will be created and shown at the top of the timeline.


#### 7. What happens when the user flips the card the first time?

We display the first data point and show some blurry fake data points to show that there is more about to happen when the user continues. We also show a motivational message until enough data
points are available to show the user's full graph.



#### 8. Is there any discovery mechanism on the graph?

Yes. If you have datapoints, each is a link that transports the user to that point in the timeline.


#### 9. Do we support hashtags and @ mentions?

Yes - but minimal functionality:
- highlight to different color. 
- We show a hover tooltip that previews 'something cool'


#### 10. Can the user delete updates, change the text, or change the associated metric?

No.

#### 19. What value do we think this whole experience creates for the user?

We believe Venturemark will make it easy for the user to have a shareable track record
