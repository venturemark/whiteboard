# UTB - Unprocessed Thought Backlog

This is just a pile of information we still have to process. As soon as somebody
has an idea a separate file can be added here. The text file can be provided as
unstructured free form. At some point we have to go through it and digest it
together. The goal eventually is to get down to the essence of what we think and
distil it into a BDR. See [the Business Decision Record docs](/bdr) for more
information.
